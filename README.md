# Awesome-chocolates-limited-project-SQL-Power-BI-
This project presents a sales performance analysis for Awesome Chocolates Ltd, combining SQL based data exploration with a Power BI interactive dashboard to uncover insights across geography, time, and salesperson performance.  The solution demonstrates how raw sales data can be queried,filtered, and analyzed using SQL, then visualized in Power BI.

🔹 Problem Statement

Sales leadership lacked:

Visibility into regional and salesperson performance

Insight into shipment efficiency (low-box shipments)

Clear understanding of monthly revenue trends

Raw data existed but was not structured, analyzed or visualized for business use.

🔹 Solution Architecture

Data → SQL → Analytics → Visualization

Queried and filtered transactional sales data using SQL

Joined sales data with geographic dimensions to enable regional analysis

Designed KPIs and efficiency metrics for operational visibility

Built Power BI dashboard for self service analytics

🔹 Technical Implementation
Data Modeling & SQL

Performed relational joins between sales and geography tables

Filtered high value and low box transactions for operational insights

Identified inefficient shipments to calculate LBS% (Low Box Shipment %)

Structured analytics ready datasets for BI visualization

Sample Analysis Use Cases

High-value sales by region

Low-volume shipment detection

Geography-specific performance analysis

🔹 Dashboard Capabilities
